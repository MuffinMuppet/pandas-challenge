# pandas-challenge

This challenge required me to analyze data containing a mix of Dsitrict and Charter Schools. Based on the results of my analysis, the District schools spent more per student and yet the Charter school student had better results in reading and math tests. This may be due to population sizes since the charter schools caters to smaller population and as such the students must recieve more focused teachings. More analysis would be done to confirm this however.

According to the analysis, the less you spent per student the higher the average reading and writing score. This tracks with the earlier conclusion about Charter schools having less budget but being more successful. And this is further established in the Scores by School Type results, were the % Overall Passing is widely skewed in favor of Charter Schools.
